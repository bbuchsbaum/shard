\title{Shared Memory Segment}
\description{
Low-level shared memory segment operations for cross-process
data sharing. These functions provide the foundation for the higher-level
\code{share()} and \code{buffer()} APIs.
}
\details{
Segments can be backed by:
\itemize{
\item \code{"shm"}: POSIX shared memory (Linux/macOS) or named file
mapping (Windows). Faster but may have size limitations.
\item \code{"mmap"}: File-backed memory mapping. Works on all platforms
and supports larger sizes.
\item \code{"auto"}: Let the system choose the best option.
}

All segments are created with secure permissions (0600 on Unix) and are
automatically cleaned up when the R object is garbage collected.

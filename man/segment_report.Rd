\title{Shared Memory Segment Report}
\usage{
segment_report()
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{shard_report} with type \code{"segment"}
containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{type}: "segment"
\item \code{timestamp}: When the report was generated
\item \code{n_segments}: Number of tracked segments
\item \code{total_bytes}: Total bytes across all segments
\item \code{segments}: List of segment details
}
}
\description{
Generates a report of active shared memory segments in the current session.
}
\details{
This function reports on segments that are currently accessible. Note that
segments are automatically cleaned up when their R objects are garbage
collected, so this only shows segments with live references.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create some segments
seg1 <- segment_create(1024)
seg2 <- segment_create(2048)
shared <- share(1:1000)

segment_report()
}
}

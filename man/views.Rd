\title{Zero-copy Views}
\description{
Views are explicit slice descriptors over shared arrays/matrices. They avoid
creating slice-sized allocations (e.g. \code{Y[, a:b]}) by carrying only metadata
plus a reference to the shared backing.
}
\details{
This is a low-level optimization handle: arbitrary base R operations may
materialize a view; use \code{materialize()} explicitly when you want a standard
matrix/array.

\title{ALTREP Shared Vectors}
\description{
ALTREP-backed zero-copy vectors for shared memory.
}
\details{
These functions create ALTREP (Alternative Representation) vectors that
are backed by shared memory segments. The key benefits are:

\itemize{
\item \strong{Zero-copy subsetting}: Contiguous subsets return views
into the same shared memory, not copies.
\item \strong{Diagnostics}: Track when data pointers are accessed or
when vectors are materialized (copied to standard R vectors).
\item \strong{Read-only protection}: Optionally prevent write access
to protect shared data.
}

Supported types: integer, double/numeric, logical, raw.
}

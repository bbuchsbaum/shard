Title: Deterministic, Zero-Copy Parallel Execution for R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    person("Bradley", "Buchsbaum", email = "brad.buchsbaum@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a parallel execution runtime for R that emphasizes
    deterministic memory behavior and efficient handling of large shared inputs.
    'shard' enables zero-copy parallel reads via shared/memory-mapped segments,
    encourages explicit output buffers to avoid large result aggregation, and
    supervises worker processes to mitigate memory drift via controlled recycling.
    Diagnostics report peak memory usage, end-of-run memory return, and hidden
    copy/materialization events to support reproducible performance benchmarking.
